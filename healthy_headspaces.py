    Depression is a significant concern among students, affecting their academic performance, social interactions, and overall well-being. Recent studies have highlighted the prevalence and impact of depression in educational settings:

    - **Prevalence**: A survey conducted across 133 college campuses during 2021‚Äì2022 found that 44% of students reported symptoms of depression, with 15% seriously considering suicide in the past year. [Source: Mayo Clinic Health System](https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/college-students-and-depression)

    - **Impact**: Mental health challenges can lead to reduced quality of life, academic difficulties, and physical health issues. Addressing these concerns is crucial for students' success and long-term well-being. [Source: Suicide Prevention Resource Center](https://sprc.org/settings/colleges-and-universities/consequences-of-student-mental-health-issues/)

    - **Trends**: While rates of anxiety and depression are at all-time highs, more college students than ever before are seeking therapy or counseling, indicating a positive shift towards addressing mental health.

    Understanding these statistics underscores the importance of early detection and intervention. Tools like this applet aim to assist in identifying potential signs of depression, encouraging timely support and resources.
