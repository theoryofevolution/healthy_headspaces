    Depression is a significant concern among students, affecting their academic performance, social interactions, and overall well-being. Recent studies have highlighted the prevalence and impact of depression in educational settings:

    - **Prevalence**: A survey conducted across 133 college campuses during 2021â€“2022 found that 44% of students reported symptoms of depression, with 15% seriously considering suicide in the past year. [Source: Mayo Clinic Health System](https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/college-students-and-depression)

    - **Impact**: Mental health challenges can lead to reduced quality of life, academic difficulties, and physical health issues. Addressing these concerns is crucial for students' success and long-term well-being. [Source: Suicide Prevention Resource Center](https://sprc.org/settings/colleges-and-universities/consequences-of-student-mental-health-issues/)

    - **Trends**: While rates of anxiety and depression are at all-time highs, more college students than ever before are seeking therapy or counseling, indicating a positive shift towards addressing mental health. [Source: University of Michigan School of Public Health](https://sph.umich.edu/news/2023posts/college-students-anxiety-depression-higher-than-ever-but-so-are-efforts-to-receive-care.html)

    Understanding these statistics underscores the importance of early detection and intervention. Tools like this applet aim to assist in identifying potential signs of depression, encouraging timely support and resources.
